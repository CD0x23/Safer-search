### What and why?

**SafeSearch** is a Chrome extension for Google searches via Duckduckgo directly from your omnibox.

I make about 200 to 400 Google searches on an average day. This tells a lot about me.
Since I care about my privacy, don't want my data to be farmed by companies and I'm too lazy to navigate to Duckduckgo and include
"!g" in my query every single time, I made this chrome extension to fasten things up.

### Usage
After setting up the extension, just click on your omnibox and hit "TAB", SafeSearch should pop up and you can enter your search query.
